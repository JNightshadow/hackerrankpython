In Python, negative infinity can be represented using floating-point values. The two primary ways to achieve this are:
Using float('-inf'): This is the most direct and common method.

    negative_infinity = float('-inf')
    print(negative_infinity)

OR

    import math
    negative_infinity = -math.inf
    print(negative_infinity)
