For the code:

```
def is_vowel(letter):
    return letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']

def score_words(words):
    score = 0
    for word in words:
        num_vowels = 0
        for letter in word:
            if is_vowel(letter):
                num_vowels += 1
        if num_vowels % 2 == 0:
            score += 2
        else:
            ++score
    return score

```
We just need to make `++score` to `score+=1` because ++ is not there for Python which is unfortunate!
