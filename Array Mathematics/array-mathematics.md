 I just wanted to add some notes regarding reshaping in python since I am not able to wrap my head around it quick enough.

 ```
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

newarr = arr.reshape(4, 3)
```
- This would convert the 12 element array into an array of 4 rows and 3 elements.<br>

`newarr = arr.reshape(1,-1)`
This converts the array into a row-wise 2d matrix as follows: <br>

`newarr = arr.reshape(-1,1)`
Output:<br>

`newarr = arr.reshape(6,2)`

`newarr = arr.reshape(2, 2,-1)` <br>

-Actually there's a lot of variations. I am finding myself confused so I suppose we'd have to try them all to get an understanding how the transformations will be. All the best! ðŸ˜…
