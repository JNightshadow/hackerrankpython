## Code
```
import re
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        creditCard = input()
        pattern = r"[456]\d{3}(-?\d{4}){3}$"
        if(not re.match(pattern,creditCard)):
            print("Invalid")
            continue
        repeatCheckPattern = r"(\d)\1{3,}"
        removedsymbols = creditCard.replace("-","")
        if( re.search(repeatCheckPattern,removedsymbols)):
            print("Invalid")
            continue
        else:
            print("Valid")
            
```
` pattern = r"[456]\d{3}(-?\d{4}){3}$" `

- `[456]` checks if the first digit is 4,5 or 6
- \d is the same as `[0-9]`, it checks whether the character is a digit or not
- {3} checks whethere there are 3 digits i.e. the next three digits have to be numbers
- `-?` indicates that a dash may or may not be present
- For now, this just validates whether the rest of the characters are digits or not.
- But for it to be validated as a credit card it shouldn't have more than 4 same consecutive digits
- To check for repetition we use the regular expression: ` repeatCheckPattern = r"(\d)\1{3,}"`
- `\1` after the digit observes one digit and checks if the rest 3 or more characters are repeating. This is how we check for repetition
We do need some practice to quickly grasp these regular expressions!

## Extra Information that I gathered while working on this code

- `re.match() vs re.search()` - If I use match() it would check if it matches the beginning of the string. So for the current problem it wouldn't work as I need to search whether there are more than 4 consecutive digits anywhere in the string!

 | Quantifier | Meaning                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `{3}`      | **Exactly** 3 times       |
| `{3,}`     | **3 or more** times       |
| `{3,5}`    | **Between 3 and 5** times |

- Using $ at the end would check the end of the string so ` repeatCheckPattern = r"(\d)\1{3}$"` would be wrong!

## üìù Notes

- `\b` ‚Üí Word boundary (used to ensure full words are matched)
- `\w+` ‚Üí One or more word characters (a‚Äìz, A‚ÄìZ, 0‚Äì9, _)
- `\1`, `\2`, etc. ‚Üí Backreferences to captured groups
- `(?:...)` ‚Üí Non-capturing group
- `(?=...)` ‚Üí Lookahead (positive)
- `(?!...)` ‚Üí Negative lookahead
- `(?<=...)` ‚Üí Lookbehind (positive)
- `(?<!...)` ‚Üí Negative lookbehind

üí° Use `re.search()` to apply these patterns to any part of a string. Always prefer raw strings (`r"pattern"`) when writing regex in Python.
