It seems that when we are using the function `sorted()` , the false values will come first and then the values matching the conditions. Hence:
```
    string = input()
    result = sorted(string, key=lambda x: (
        x.isdigit(),  
        x.isupper(),           
        int(x) % 2 == 0 if x.isdigit() else False,  
        x                      
    ))
```
- Here, we were required that the elements be sorted in the following way:
    - All sorted lowercase letters are ahead of uppercase letters.
    - All sorted uppercase letters are ahead of digits.
    - All sorted odd digits are ahead of sorted even digits.
- Thus the first condition is given as idigit(), so the false ones will come first.
- Then it checks if it is upper, so the false one would come first.
- Then we are checking if the values that are numeric are even - thus the false values would come first.
- Finally all the other values.
