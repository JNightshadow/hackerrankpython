## Things I've learned:

- We can just use _ in for loop when we don't need to the use the variable that gets iterated!
- If we're not gonna use the input as per the problem given, we may as well just not store it and simply execute: `input()` - this is new to me.
- This is trivial but if we are just printing "True" or "False" we might as well do `print(condition)`..
  These are not really relevant in the grant scheme of coding but this was interesting to me, hence I made some notes lol.
